How does your gem take advantage of Rubyâ€™s metaprogramming capabilities?

    My gem uses the class_eval to generate each of the color methods.
    I also used the send object method to call each of the methods for to generate the
    output in sample_colors.

How long did you spend working on this project?

    I spent about 8 - 10 hours working on this project. I had to review the lesson
    multiple times in order to understand what was going on.

What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?

    The most rewarding challenge was when I found out how to use the send method
    to call each of the color methods for the sample_colors method in my string.
    It took me several hours to find a way of calling all my color methods using
    a loop instead of one by one.

Where do you still have room to grow?

    I need to learn how to ask better questions. The reason why it took me so long
    to find out I could use the send method was because I understood what I wanted
    to do, but I did not know how to ask or communicate my problem.
